LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of hardware acceleration and programming languages research. The core mission is to bring ideas we love from software programming languages and tools to the world of hardware design.

## Attending the Workshop

LATTE will be co-located with [ASPLOS][] 2026.
It will run in a hybrid format, i.e., it will be possible to join either in person (in Pittsburgh) or online (on Zoom).
Talks at the workshop can use either modality, so please consider submitting even if you cannot attend in person.

See the [call for papers][cfp] for more details.

## LATTE Matrix Chat

We have set up a matrix chat to keep the latte community in touch outside the
main LATTE event. [Join it here][matrix]. Any vaguely LATTE-related discussion
is encouraged! Showcase cool projects you built, discuss new ideas or problems
you've run into, or just hang out with the community.
