LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of hardware acceleration and programming languages research. The core mission is to bring ideas we love from software programming languages and tools to the world of hardware design. See the [call for papers][cfp] for more details.

## Attending LATTE

LATTE is a hybrid workshop; please consider attending either in person (in Pittsburgh, co-located with [ASPLOS][]) or virtually (on Zoom). LATTE will be held on March 23, 2026.

* To attend in person, [register to attend ASPLOS workshops][asplos-reg].
* To attend virtually, no conference registration is required. Please [sign up using this Zoom form][zoom] to receive a link to join.

## LATTE Matrix Chat

We have set up a matrix chat to keep the latte community in touch outside the
main LATTE event. [Join it here][matrix]. Any vaguely LATTE-related discussion
is encouraged! Showcase cool projects you built, discuss new ideas or problems
you've run into, or just hang out with the community.

## Program
