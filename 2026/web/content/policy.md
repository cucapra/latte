# Workshop Policies

At LATTE, we host PDFs of accepted papers on our website.
Authors have a chance to prepare a camera-ready revision; we then post this on the workshop's program page.

## No Proceedings

LATTE does not have an archival proceedings.
Position papers accepted at LATTE do not go into the ACM Digital Library and they do not get a DOI.
We informally host them on the workshop's website.

We believe that this means that LATTE papers do not preclude any future or concurrent publications.
For example, ACM's [policy on simultaneous submissions][simul] says:

> Issuing the paper as a technical report, posting the paper on a web site, or presenting the paper at a workshop or conference that does not publish formally reviewed proceedings does not disqualify it from appearing in an ACM publication.

## Temporary Removal

Unfortunately, some reviewers do not follow the above policy.
At least once, a misguided reviewer has penalized a full-paper submission for being too close to a LATTE paper about the same work.
Reviewers who do this are confused about publication policies, but they do exist.

Therefore, while we discourage it, we allow LATTE authors to request that we *temporarily* remove a LATTE paper from the website for a period of time.
If you want to do this, please pick a reasonable span of time to remove the paper and contact the workshop organizers.
We will still make the paper available to workshop attendees.
