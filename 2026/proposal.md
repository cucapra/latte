Workshop on Languages, Tools, and Techniques for Accelerator Design 

# Workshop/Tutorial Abbreviation

LATTE '25

# Abstract

The world deserves better tools for designing custom hardware accelerators. We believe the world of programming languages research can help. New language designs, compiler optimizations, program analyses, type systems, testing frameworks, auxiliary engineering tools like debuggers and profilers: all these topics have deep research traditions in software, and they all have a role to play in making hardware design better.

LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of hardware acceleration and programming languages research. The core mission is to bring ideas we love from software programming languages and tools to the world of hardware design.

LATTE solicits short position papers that need not fit the mold of a traditional publication:

    Early, in-progress research snapshots
    Experience reports on building or deploying accelerators and the tools involved
    Essays advocating for or against a general approach
    Retrospectives on past efforts on tools, languages, and techniques for accelerator design
    Calls for solutions to open challenges in the area (questions without answers)
    Demonstrations of real systems (to be shown off in a live demo at the workshop)
    Overviews of open-source projects, even when the novelty with respect to proprietary alternatives is limited

# Procedure on Selecting Papers for Presentations

People who are interested in presenting submit 2 page position papers for
presentation. Those are reveiwed by a program committee which we try to keep
around 15-20 people, primarily people in the later part of their PhD or early
in their post-PhD careers. Papers are primarily evaluated on their possibility
for sparking discussion as mentioned in the abstract.

We also usually have one or 2 keynotes or invited speakers.

# Tentative Schedule

We will put up a CFP as soon as the workshop is accepted. The deadline for
submissions will be in mid january, with author notification of acceptance in
early-mid february.

The schedule at the workshop itself will consist of short presentation with
ample discussion between presentations. We will also have some dedicated
discussion sessions to address bigger picture topics than those presented in
the papers.

This will be the 5th LATTE and we don't intend to make any major changes. You can therefore get a good sense of the structure from previous years
