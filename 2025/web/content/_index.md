LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of hardware acceleration and programming languages research. The core mission is to bring ideas we love from software programming languages and tools to the world of hardware design. For more details on the workshop's focus, see [the call for papers][cfp].

## The 2025 Workshop

LATTE is a hybrid workshop; please consider attending either in person (in Rotterdam, co-located with [ASPLOS][]) or virtually (on Zoom). LATTE will be held on March 30.

## LATTE Matrix Chat

We have set up a matrix chat to keep the latte community in touch outside the
main latte event. [Join it here][matrix]. Any vaguely latte-related discussion
is encouraged! Showcase cool projects you built, discuss new ideas or problems
you've run into, or just hang out with the community.

## Call for Papers

See the [call for papers][cfp] for details on how to submit your work to LATTE.
