LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of hardware acceleration and programming languages research. The core mission is to bring ideas we love from software programming languages and tools to the world of hardware design. For more details on the workshop's focus, see [the call for papers][cfp].

## The 2025 Workshop

LATTE is a hybrid workshop; please consider attending either in person (in Rotterdam, co-located with [ASPLOS][]) or virtually (on Zoom). LATTE will be held on March 30.

### Overview

The world deserves better tools for designing custom hardware accelerators. We believe the world of programming languages research can help. New language designs, compiler optimizations, program analyses, type systems, testing frameworks, auxiliary engineering tools like debuggers and profilers: all these topics have deep research traditions in software, and they all have a role to play in making hardware design better.

LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming at the intersection of hardware acceleration and programming languages research. The core mission is to bring ideas we love from software programming languages and tools to the world of hardware design.

LATTE has a special focus on open-source research. We encourage work that comes with real, permissively licensed implementations.

For LATTE, "hardware" includes ASICs, FPGAs, CGRAs, and other reconfigurable hardware. While the scope is broad, here are a few ideas to get you started:

- Domain-specific languages for accelerator design
- Compilers for optimizing hardware designs
- Verification, testing, and debugging techniques
- Virtualization schemes for specialized & reconfigurable hardware

LATTE solicits short position papers that need not fit the mold of a traditional publication:

- Early, in-progress research snapshots
- Experience reports on building or deploying accelerators and the tools involved
- Essays advocating for or against a general approach
- Retrospectives on past efforts on tools, languages, and techniques for accelerator design
- Calls for solutions to open challenges in the area (questions without answers)
- Demonstrations of real systems (to be shown off in a live demo at the workshop)
- Overviews of open-source projects, even when the novelty with respect to proprietary alternatives is limited

## Tentative Program

Here's a tentative schedule for the workshop. All times are in Rotterdam time (Central European Summer Time).

## Hybrid Format

LATTE 2025 will run in a hybrid format, i.e., it will be possible to join either in person (in Rotterdam) or online (on Zoom).
Talks at the workshop can use either modality, so please consider submitting even if you cannot attend in person.

## LATTE Matrix Chat

We have set up a matrix chat to keep the latte community in touch outside the
main latte event. [Join it here][matrix]. Any vaguely latte-related discussion
is encouraged! Showcase cool projects you built, discuss new ideas or problems
you've run into, or just hang out with the community.
